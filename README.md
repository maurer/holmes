A system for integrating multiple analyses using a logic language.

## Requirements
* **Rust** - Holmes is developed against [Rust 1.14.0](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.14.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz).

* **PostgreSQL** - Holmes uses **PostgreSQL** to back its datastore.
  I develop and test against 9.5 on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/maurer/holmes).
  Other backing stores may become available in the future.

* **Linux/X86_64** - This is not an explicit dependency.
  To the best of my knowledge, all tools I am using work on OSX/Windows and I am not using any architecture specific hacks.
  However, I am not developing on other architectures/OSes, nor will I be testing on them until things are much more feature complete.
